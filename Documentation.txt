Project 1: Audio Visualizer

In order to meet the usability requirement, I have labeled my widgnets clearly, and wrote clear instructions as to how to use them.
I have also set the default scene to a pleasing preset.
It is an interactive design because it includes four songs for the user to choose from, and there are two sliders, one for circle size, and one for bass boosting.
I have also included three filters, and a color picker.
To meet the canvas API requirement, I have included all the lines, bezier curves, circles, a gradient, rectangles, and a bitmapped image.
The frequency data is used for both the ring and the heartbeats, while the waveform is used for the bezier curve.
I made the code well commented and efficent enough to run at a smooth rate with no runtime error.

If I had more time, I would like to format my UI better and add a filter which would allow the user to feel as though they are in a astronaut helmet.

I believe this project should be graded 100, and a 90 with the penalty for lateness.
